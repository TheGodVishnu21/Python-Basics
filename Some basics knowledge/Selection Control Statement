Selection control statements in Python are used to execute specific blocks of code based on certain conditions. There are two main types of selection control statements:

1. **if Statement**: The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true. It can be followed by an optional `elif` (short for "else if") statement to check additional conditions, and an optional `else` statement to execute a block of code if none of the conditions are true.

2. **if-else Statement**: The `if-else` statement combines the `if` statement with an `else` statement. If the condition specified in the `if` statement is true, the block of code under the `if` statement is executed. Otherwise, the block of code under the `else` statement is executed.

These selection control statements allow you to control the flow of your Python program based on various conditions. They help you make decisions and execute specific actions accordingly.

Additionally, you can use nested `if` statements to handle more complex conditions by placing one `if` statement inside another.
