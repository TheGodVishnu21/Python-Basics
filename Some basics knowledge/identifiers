In Python, identifiers are names given to variables, functions, classes, modules, or other objects. Identifiers are case-sensitive and can consist of letters (both lowercase and uppercase), digits, and underscores (_), but they must follow certain rules:

1. The first character of an identifier must be a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
2. The remaining characters can be letters, digits (0-9), or underscores (_).
3. Identifiers cannot start with a digit.
4. Python keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
5. Identifiers can be of any length.

Here are some examples of valid and invalid identifiers:

Valid Identifiers:
- my_variable
- myVar
- _my_variable
- MY_CONSTANT
- MyClass
- add_numbers

Invalid Identifiers:
- 123variable (starts with a digit)
- class (a Python keyword)
- my-variable (contains hyphen, not allowed)
- @my_variable (contains special character, not allowed)

Example usage:

```python
# Valid identifiers
my_variable = 42
myVar = "Hello"
_my_variable = True
MY_CONSTANT = 3.14
MyClass = None
add_numbers = lambda x, y: x + y

# Invalid identifiers
# 123variable = 42   # SyntaxError: invalid syntax (starts with a digit)
# class = "Python"   # SyntaxError: invalid syntax (Python keyword)
# my-variable = 10   # SyntaxError: can't assign to operator (contains hyphen)
# @my_variable = 20  # SyntaxError: can't assign to operator (contains special character)
```

In Python, it's important to choose meaningful and descriptive identifiers to make your code more readable and understandable.
